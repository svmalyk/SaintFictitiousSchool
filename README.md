## Installation

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js**: Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
* **MongoDB**: Make sure you have a running instance of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
* **Git**: Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) if you don’t already have it.

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-management-software.git
   cd school-management-software
   ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

   The backend server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

5. Start the frontend application:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the software is running, you can:

* Log in as an **admin** to manage users (students, teachers, etc.)
* Log in as a **teacher** to manage your classes, grades, and attendance
* Log in as a **student** to check grades, attend classes, and view schedules
* Log in as a **parent** to view their child's performance and attendance

### Example API Endpoints

* **POST** `/api/login` - Log in to the system
* **GET** `/api/students` - Get all students (Admin)
* **POST** `/api/students` - Add a new student (Admin)
* **GET** `/api/attendance` - Get the attendance for a specific class
* **POST** `/api/attendance` - Mark attendance for a student or teacher

You can test the API using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
